# Versioning policy and support

## Versioning

I follow the [semantic versioning v2](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) in my projects.

This means that, in an major.minor.patch versioning scheme:

    - major: means there is something requires your action to upgrade
    - minor: means there is something has been added or improved that you may benefit from, if you put in the minimum effort to upgrade.
    - patch: means there is something has been fixed, you should be able to upgrade without much effort

## Dependency upgrades

I regularly upgrade dependencies and dependency requirements for my projects,
and often do have automation in place to do so at set time intervals.
